            <hr class="intro-divider">
            <br/>
	    <p><font size="4px"> I am currently a research scientist in the External Research Department at <a href="https://citrine.io/" target="_blank">Citrine Informatics</a>, specializing in materials informatics. Previously, I worked as a postdoc in the <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/science/staff/stfsrchresults.asp?id=983" target="_blank">Basic & Applied Molecular Foundations Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/" target="_blank">Pacific Northwest National Laboratory</a>. My research focused on the computational study of CO<sub>2</sub> capture and catalysis.</font></p>
                <p><font size="4px"> I received my B.S. in Applied Mathematics (emphasis in Physics) from UC Riverside in 2015. I then joined UC Riverside's Materials Science & Engineering graduate program in the <a href="http://www.bmwong-group.com/" target="_blank">Nanoscale & Mesoscale Energy Materials Research Group</a>. After completing my M.S., I joined Peter A. Greaney's <a href="http://alexgreaney.com/" target="_blank">Computational Materials Group</a> to finish my PhD. The focus of my dissertation was the atomistic modeling of amorphous materials, particularly amorphous metal oxides and water-in-salt electrolytes. </font></p>
                <p><font size="4px"> In my research, I combine atomistic modeling, both at the electronic (quantum) and atomic (classical) level, with machine learning methods. I am excited and passionate about developing new ways to solve novel problems in materials science and chemistry <i>in silico</i> in order to accelerate scientific discovery.</font></p>
